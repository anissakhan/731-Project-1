# Project 1

### Scope

The purpose of this project is to upload and merge Pesticide use and Cancer datasets and to become familiar with Pandas and Jupyter Notebook. I run preliminary summary statistics and data visualizations. These datasets could potentially be used to determine a relationship between pesticide use and cancer incidence.

Please see the Jupyter Notebook for more details.

### Data
Datasets obtained from:
1. https://www.kaggle.com/usgs/pesticide-use?select=2014.csv
2. https://www.kaggle.com/dannellyz/cancer-incidence-totals-and-rates-per-us-county

### Variable descriptions
1. Cancer Dataset:
     - Incidence_rate_per_100k: Median Age-Adjusted Incidence Rate cases per 100,000. Adjusted to the 2000 US standard population.
     - avg_annual_count: Average Annual Count of cancer diagnosis from 2012-2016
     - recent_trend: Recent Trend movement over the last 5 years. Three options: ["falling","stable","rising"]
     - five_year_incidence_change_rate: Median rate of Incidence Change over five year period
     - stateFIPS: Federal Information Processing Standard State Code
     - incidence_rate_per_100k_low_95: Lower 95th Percentile for Age-Adjusted Incidence Rate cases per 100,000.
     - incidence_rate_per_100k_high_95: Upper 95th Percentile for Age-Adjusted Incidence Rate cases per 100,000.
     - five_year_incidence_change_rate_low_95: Lower 95th Percentile for rate of incidence change
     - five_year_incidence_change_rate_high_95: Upper 95th Percentile for rate of incidence change
